# GEWISPHP Coding Standards

The GEWISPHP Coding Standard is a set of [PHP_CodeSniffer](https://github.com/PHPCSStandards/PHP_CodeSniffer) rules that are applied to all PHP projects of Study Association GEWIS. These standards are heavily based on the [Doctrine Coding Standard](https://github.com/doctrine/coding-standard) and the [Slevomat Coding Standard](https://github.com/slevomat/coding-standard).
